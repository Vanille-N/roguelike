# Repeat:

The user can press the keypad 0 to 9 keys (when focussing
on the board (press `q` in in the command line).

Each press of a digit on the numpad will chage an internal
integer variable `repeat`.
When pressing `n` to make the game evolve, `repeat` steps
will be achieved.

Pressing Escape will turn thus variable back to 1.



Caution: `step n` may freeze the program for a long period
of time for "big" values of `n` (e.g. > 1000)
